        <u>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur</u>: Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the
        clade <i>Dinosauria</i>. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23
        million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the
        subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the
        Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 million years ago; their dominance continued
        throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record demonstrates that birds
        are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late
        Jurassic epoch. As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the
        Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs can
        therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and non-avian dinosaurs, which are all
        dinosaurs other than birds. \n
        Dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from taxonomic, morphological and ecological
        standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living species, are the most diverse group of vertebrates
        besides perciform fish. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 500
        distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are
        represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through
        the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of
        the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most
        research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active
        animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were
        herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were egg-laying; and
        that nest-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian. \n
        While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal, many extinct groups included quadrupedal species,
        and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such as
        horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed
        skeletal modifications such as bony armor and spines. While the dinosaurs\' modern-day
        surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many
        prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied—the largest sauropod dinosaurs
        are estimated to have reached lengths of 39.7 meters (130 feet) and heights of 18 m (59 ft)
        and were the largest land animals of all time. Still, the idea that non-avian dinosaurs were
        uniformly gigantic is a misconception based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy
        bones are more likely to last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite small:
        Xixianykus, for example, was only about 50 centimeters (20 inches) long. \n
        Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted fossil
        dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs
        have become an enduring part of world culture. The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as
        well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs\' regular
        appearance in best-selling books and films, such as Jurassic Park. Persistent public
        enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new
        discoveries are regularly covered by the media.</string>
